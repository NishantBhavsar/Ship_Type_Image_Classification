## Problem Statement
Ship or vessel detection has a wide range of applications, in the areas of maritime safety,  fisheries management, marine pollution, defence and maritime security, protection from piracy, illegal migration, etc.

Keeping this in mind, a Governmental Maritime and Coastguard Agency is planning to deploy a computer vision based automated system to identify ship type only from the images taken by the survey boats. You have been hired as a consultant to build an efficient model for this project.


## Data description

There are 5 classes of ships to be detected.

There are 6252 images in train and 2680 images in test data. The categories of ships and their corresponding codes in the dataset are as follows -

```
{'Cargo': 1, 
'Military': 2, 
'Carrier': 3, 
'Cruise': 4, 
'Tankers': 5}
```
